# Visualizing-gender-and-race-representation-in-movies
In this project, I use pandas and matplotlib to visualize data on gender and race representation in movies. The representation 
of gender and race is measured using the bechdel, waithe and ko tests, the description for which is embedded in the 
jupyter notebook file.
